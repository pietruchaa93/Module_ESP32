# Module_ESP32
Simple code to read the value from ESP32 and control the LED lamp built into the microcontroller.

The task of ESP32 is to read values ​​such as:
- information about the microcontroller version
- WIFI MAC address
- supply voltage
- microcontroller operation time from startup and LED control.

You can then use HTTP requests to read and control them, e.g. with Asp.Net Core.
